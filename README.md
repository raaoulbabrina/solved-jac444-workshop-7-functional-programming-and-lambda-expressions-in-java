This assignment lets you practice basic Functional Programming and Lambda Expressions in Java.

<strong> </strong>

In this assignment, you will be adding some code to the workshop 3 (shapes) as follows:

<u>Task 4:</u> Define a functional interface to calculate the area of a shape. Create an object of that interface in each of the <strong>Circle, Square, Rectangle </strong>classes, <em>using lambda expressions</em>.




Print all the shapes and their perimeters polymorphically, as you did in task 1 (donâ€™t forget that you are using <em>just one</em> <strong>Shape</strong> array) but in cases that the shape being printed is an object of these classes (i.e. <strong>Circle, Square, Rectangle</strong>), print their areas (<em>using the above mentioned objects you created</em>) as well.
